## Developer Thoughts

This part of the project contains a completed landing page and and a tool that is a work in progress. 

My plan was to create a point based system based on responses from 15-20 questions to assign a product collection and theme. After that, some of the question inputs would be fed into a large language model, like Chat-GPT via API to assist with finer details such as a store name, slogan, logo, etc. My suggestion is to take a look at the tool, the logic, and my thoughts and decide if you want to continue with that path or start over.

I want this to be as easy as possible for you to continue this project in any way you see fit, making the only real requirements knowledge of Next.js, TS, and Tailwind. 

The backend work that I have done is using Shopify to get products from various drop shipping services as base collections, then copy the desired collection as a standalone to handle the products for each generated store. This way the template collections would not be modifiable, but the copies can (allowing users to add or remove products and track specific details). This requires a lot of knowledge of the Shopify ecosystem and in-depth knowledge of the Admin and Storefront APIs.

My suggestion is to scrap that and design your own system if you do not have that specific knowledge and experience to complete this project using Shopify as a backend/headless CMS. My contact information will be left down below to answer any questions that I can.
